## Requirements

You need to have docker installed and running in your machine. If you don't have it you can download it here: [Download Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

Also you need to have python installed in your machine. Usually you already have it on your system, but if you don't you can download it here: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Run the WebApp

To run the WebApp you only need to situate yourself on the back directory and execute the exec.py file, since it will automatically download the requirements.txt and run de webapp for you. These are the steps:
`cd ./back`  
`python exec.py`
